# grande
A simple chrome extension that allows you to enlarge text.

### Why?
A linguist friend of mine asked me how could they enlarge certain characters automatically on a page, so I made this.
This is primarily to aid the viewing languages with small and dense scripts like Arabic, Persian, and Chinese.
